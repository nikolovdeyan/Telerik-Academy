Bugs:

#1 In FileLogger the error logging was disabled by commenting the logger command. This prevented outputing error messsages in the log.txt
#2 In CommandProcessor there was an unreachable segment of code (commented with "do not remove"), it was removed;
#3 In CommandsFactory --> BuildCommand() the variable `end` was not used anywhere else, so it was removed;
#4 In CreateUserCommand --> In Execute() new Database and ModelsFactory were created, preventing proper program execution; 
Fixed by passing these parameters. The command also needed to be passed in the CommandsFactory switch
#5 In CommandsFactory there was a middle man method BuildCommand() whose sole purpose was to lower the case of the command.

Bottleneck:

#1 In CommandsFactory the following line performs a needless loop:
	while (DateTime.Now < end) ;
