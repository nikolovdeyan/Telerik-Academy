# C# and .NET Differences

## Description
- Describe the difference between **C#** and **.NET Framework** in 2-3 sentences.
- Write your description in a text file called **csharp-and-dot-net-framework.txt**. Use English.


### Differences DEscription
 While C# is a programming language, just as C++ and Visual Basic, .NET is the framework that is designed around the following objectives <sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup>:
 
- Provide consistent OOP environment whether object code is stored and executed locally, executed locally but Internet-distributed, or executed remotely.
- Provide code-execution environment that minimizes software deployment and versioning conflicts.
- Provide a code-execution environment that promotes safe execution of code
- Make the developer experience consistent across widely varying types of applications
- To build all communication on industry standards to ensure that code based on the .NET FW can integrate with any other code.

C# programs run on the .NET Framework, an integral component of Windows that includes a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a unified  set of libraries

>The distinction between a language, a runtime, and a library is more strict in .NET/C# than for example in C++, where the language specification also includes some basic library functions <sup id="a2">[[2]](#f2)</sup>
