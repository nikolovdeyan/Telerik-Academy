# Programming Languages

## Assembly
Assembly or assembler language is a low-level programming language with a very strong corresponce between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Therefore each particular architecture has its own assembly language. Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a utility program -- assembler. Assembly uses mnemonic to represent each low-level machine instruction or operation and many operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction.

## C
C is a general-purpose, imperative procedural programming language. It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion and has a static type system that prevents unintended operations. C provides constructs that map efficientrly to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has replaced Assembly in many applications, including OS. 

## C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. Many programming languages have been influenced by C++, including Java, C#, D.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web content production. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative and functional programming styles. 

## Python
Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. The design philosophy of Python emphasizes code readability and the syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in other languages. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional-programming or procedural styles. It has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management, alongside with a comprehensive and large standard library.
