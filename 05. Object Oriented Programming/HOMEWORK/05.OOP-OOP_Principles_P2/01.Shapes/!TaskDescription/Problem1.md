### Problem 1. Shapes
*	Define abstract class `Shape` with only one `abstract` method `CalculateSurface()` and fields `width` and `height`.
*	Define two new classes `Triangle` and `Rectangle` that implement the `virtual` method and return the surface of the figure (height * width for rectangle and height * width/2 for triangle).
*	Define class `Square` and suitable constructor so that at initialization `height` must be kept equal to `width` and implement the `CalculateSurface()` method.
*	Write a program that tests the behaviour of the `CalculateSurface()` method for different shapes (`Square`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`) stored in an array.
