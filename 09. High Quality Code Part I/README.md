=====================================

The free course "C# Fundamentals" introduces students to the fundamentals of programming. The course focuses on fundamental programming concepts using C#/.NET and Visual Studio. The course covers topics such as **data types**, **variables**, **operators**, **arithmetic expressions**, **Console Input/Output**, **conditional statements** (`if-else`, `switch-case`) and **loops** (`while`, `do-while`, `for`, `foreach`).

The training is practice-oriented and involves solving hundreds of problems, which develop students' algorithmic thinking and skills.
