Development Environments
=====================================

## Description
- Perform a research (e.g. in _Google_ or _Wikipedia_) and provide a short list with popular development environments (**IDE**s) like Visual Studio.
- Write in a text file called **list-of-IDEs.txt** at least five IDEs along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

--------------------

## IDEs

I decided to split this short research into two parts as my search showed that a lot of programmers actually do not prefer to work with IDEs, but use simple (or not so simple) text editors. So let's first focus on the actual task and check out which are the most used IDEs:

Using several sources<sup id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</sup> showed the following trends for most used IDEs and text editors. There are no comprehensive studies about that topic, so the data should be taken with a grain of salt.

### Eclipse
Eclipse is the most widely used Java IDE. It contains a base workspace and an 4etensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. Eclipse is mostly written in Java. Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala. Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP. Eclipse SDK is free and open-source software released under the terms of the Eclipse Public License. Big advantages that users preferred about Eclipse are the Language Extensibility, and the fact that the IDE is free. What is turning some users off is the steep learning curve.

### Visual Studio
Visual studio is mostly used by corporate programmers to produce .NET code. Main advantages that are preferred for this IDE by its users are Intellisense, automatic code formatting, extensibility. Main disadvantages that bothered users are the resource usage, the overwhelming GUI, and of course, the cost (VS is not free)

### Android Studio
Android Studio is a relatively new IDE, introduced in 2013 at the Google I/O conference. Since then it has seen a very fast adoption, growing the most in the last 5 years according to TOP IDE. It is designed specifically for Android development and is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Android studio includes Android specific refactoring and quick fixes, template-based wizards to create common Android designs and components, a rich layout editor with drag-and-drop functionality, etc. 

### NetBeans
NetBeans is the number one alternative to Eclipse, being a free and extensible IDE that can also compile code. It comes along with a Java server called GlassFish that can be deployed for testing environment. What users liked the most about NetBeans is the extensibility, that it can compile code, and that it is free. What users didn't like about it is that it seems somewhat bloated and can slow down your machine. 

### Xcode
Xcode is an IDE with a suite of software development tools developed by Apple with the purpose for developing software for macOS, iOS, WatchOS and tvOS. It supports source code for many programming languages, including C, C++, Objective-C, Java, Python, Rubym etc. There is also added support by third parties for other languages, such as C#, Perl, D, among others.

## Text Editors as IDEs
A lot of programmers actually report that they do not like or use any full-fledged IDEs at all. They prefer text editors and defend their decision with passion. The most used are:

### Notepad++
Notepad++ is one of the most popular text editors around. It supports tabbed editing, is distributed as free software, and has been downloaded from SourceForge.net more than 28 million times. 

### Vim
Vim is a clone of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix. It is designed for use both from a CLI, and as a stand-alone applicatio in a GUI. It is free and open source. It is cross-platform. Stack Overflow's developer survey found it to be the third most popular text editor. 

### nano
nano is a text editor for Unix-like systems using the CLI. It emulates the Pico text editor, and is licensed under the GNU GPL. 

### Emacs
Emacs is much more than a text editor -- it is even compared to an operating system. Emacs is characterized by its exensibility. Its development began in mid 1970s and is still actively ongoing. It has over 2,000 built-in commands and allows the user to combine them in macros and scripts. Emacs and vi are the two main contenders in the traditional Unix editor wars. Both are among the oldest application programs still in use.
