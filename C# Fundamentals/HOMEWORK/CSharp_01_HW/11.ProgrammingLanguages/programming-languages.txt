Assembly or assembler language is a low-level programming language with a very strong corresponce between the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Therefore each particular architecture has its own assembly language. Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a utility program -- assembler. Assembly uses mnemonic to represent each low-level machine instruction or operation and many operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction.

C is a general-purpose, imperative procedural programming language. It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion and has a static type system that prevents unintended operations. C provides constructs that map efficientrly to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has replaced Assembly in many applications, including OS.
