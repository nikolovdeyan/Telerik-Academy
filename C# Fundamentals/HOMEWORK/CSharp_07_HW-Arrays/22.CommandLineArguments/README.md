Command line arguments
========================

## Description
For this task, use only the command line and a text editor. 
Create a folder(name it however you want), navigate into it and create a `CLI.cs` file. 
Open the `CLI.cs` file from the command line with whatever text editor you're comfortable with. 
Write a program that, when compiled to an executable, is run from the command line. Also, you should pass parameters(numbers) to it. 
Your executable should be called like that:

```bash
./CLI.exe 1 20 33 45 66 17
```

All parameters passed to your executable should be parsed to integers and summed. Print the sum on the console.

| Call                | Output       |
|:--------------------|:-------------|
| ./CLI.exe 1 2 3 4 5 | 15           |
| ./CLI.exe 10 10     | 20           |
| ./CLI.exe 7 8 13 33 | 61           |
