# Project Manager Tool

## Design Patterns Exam, 15 June 2017

Refactor and complete the project management system.
Application description

About a month ago a development team from your company started to refactor the Project Management System which you are about to use in order to enhance your team's productivity. Initially, the system has been developed by junior developers and after some time a few senior members joined the team. Later on, the team switched to another project so you are the one man band now. The code is in some odd state of having all the needed interfaces to complete refactoring the system but not all of them have been used. You know "THE BOOK", right? Your task is to complete the refactoring following all the principles you have learnt (I hope :D ) so far and build the best project ever.

#### Guidelines:

    There are 2 projects and 1 test project. One of them is the framework and the other is the client.
    Both projects are splitted as this is an essential part of decoupling your application. In fact, building the framework is the main focus of this application and it should be done using all the SOLID principles. This will allow you to disconnect the client from the framework.
    All the modules of your application should be interchangeable, so you should use Dependency Inversion, as you already know from the course.
    On the client side of the project, you will need to utilize an IoC container (Ninject in this case).
    In order to meet the performance, you will have to cache the projects. Once you have to list them, you will have to return cached version of the list (for 20 seconds).
    Last but not least, you will need to cover the system with UNIT tests.
    Some steps already done for you:
    Extracted a new Framework project where you will build your framework's internals.
    In your client IoC container is installed (Ninject) and there is added ConfigurationProvider, which will enable you to add code for logging/caching functionality (based on configuration in your app.config, in the client project file).

Input

The input is read from the console and consists of a sequence of commands, each on a single line. The input ends by the "Exit" command.
Output

The output is also the same and should be on the console. It should consist of the outputs from each of the commands from the input sequence. There is, however, a new functionality you have to implement. You should add caching when ListProjects command is executed.

 - Hint 1: Check what's going on in the following files in the CLI project (the architect left some goodies) - StartUp, IConfigurationProvider, ConfigurationProvider, NinjectManagerModule, App.config.
 
 - Hint 2: Check the files CacheableCommand and ValidatableCommand and think about how to use them according to the use case
 
 - Hint 3: All the needed interfaces are there for you (thank me later).
 
 - Hint 4: SimpleInterceptor for writing the result of ProcessCommand

#### Application requirements

Follow the good object orientated programming and (especially) dependency inversion practices and principles. Modifying things that you are NOT allowed to modify will result in a penalty for each violation.
##### Problem 1. Code Refactoring (35 points)

###### Refactor the code in both Framework and ConsoleClient projects following the best practices introduced in the Design Patterns course:

 - Do not modify ModelsFactory class. Don't try to use IoC container there.git

 - Replace all usages of the new keyword with a corresponding architectural approach (design pattern) in all the classes: (except internal .NET classes such as StringBuilder, List, Exception types and etc.).

 - Remove the switch case in CommandsFactory class and use the IoC container. It is okay to depend on it in this class. (Service Locator - please, no :) )

 - Use an IoC container to compose all of the refactored code and allow to decouple the CLI from the framework and, of course, to allow unit testing.

##### Problem 2. Unit Tests (25 points)

###### Design and fully implement unit tests for:

    CacheableCommand class
    CachingService class
    LogErrorInterceptor class

Any other code is not required to be tested. You should cover the public methods. Be sure to test all major execution scenarios + all interesting border cases. You can use VSTT, VSTT v2 or NUnit. Where applicable your tests should use mocking with JustMock or Moq.
Problem 3. New Features (40 points)

Implement caching functionality for the ListProjects command. Look at the CachingService class and the ConsoleClient for ideas how to use it.

    Remove the validation from the commands. Use another approach to achieve the validation in one place.

    You should implement error logging and printing info about the CommandProcessor class.

    Remove the try-catch block in the Engine class and think about how to use the IoC container to achieve the same functionality over the CommandProcessor
        The only line which should replace the whole try-catch block should be this one: this.processor.ProcessCommand(commandLine);
        You should not write or log here (except for the exit command).

    The CachingService is ready for you. Use it to cache the ListProjects command. If you have already done the validation, use this approach here as well.

    INFO ABOUT CACHING: When ListProjects is called the first time, it prints out the list of the projects already added and cache it, then every other call will return the cached version for 20 seconds (look at app.config file in ConsoleClient). Even if you add another project and then call ListProjects again, it should return the cached version if the cache is not expired yet.

    You are NOT allowed to change, or move in other projects, the IConfigurationProvider interface and ConfigurationProvider class

Zero tests

You can also find them in the Tests folder.

Notice that ListProjects is always returning all the added projects. After implementing caching functionality, you should see cached projects for 20 seconds (or the time you added in the app.config file). The first test shows the difference.
01. Input

```
CreateProject DeathStar 2016-1-1 2018-05-04 Active
ListProjects
CreateProject SomeOtherStarWarsStuff 2016-1-1 2018-05-04 Active
ListProjects
Exit
```

01. Expected output (Without caching. Notice the listing after adding the second project!)
