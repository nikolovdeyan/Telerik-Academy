# Project Manager Tool -- Grading Criteria

If the full name of the CommandProcessor class is printed on the console when you start the application, ignore it :). It is caused by the Bytes2You validation library. Look in the Engine class in the author's solution.

    - the class is missing and the NinjectModule setups the Factory through the interface (auto-implemented factory) (7 points)

    - No (0 point)
.
2. ValidatableCommand decorator is bound through Ninject in the NinjectManagerModule and decorates all the existing commands

    - This functionality is implemented in the LogErrorInterceptor (1 point)
    - No (0 point)

8. CommandProcessor is Intercepted with the InfoInterceptor in the NinjectManagerModule.
